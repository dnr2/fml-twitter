# Implement more algorithms (So far: SVM, Adaboost)
# Create Slides (Cody doing)
# graphs and Tables
	Confusion Matrix (for the 2 best and 2 worse features)
	Accuracy (comparison between algorithms)
	ROC curve (?)
# NLP
	Q: how to extract features considering the different possible languages the user speak?
	Q: how to extract features considering the use of symbols, 
	Analyse the user names using n-grams
